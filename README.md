# Peace 
#### A Speech to sign language translator made for our submission to Local Hack Day 2019: Build Day
#### Made with:
* Android Studio 
* Microsoft Azure's cognitive speech SDK
____
#### Inspiration
We wanted to bridge the gap between deaf people and their peers by helping people learn how to better communicate in ASL. 
____
#### What it does
Translates speech or text to sign language to help users learn sign language and communicate with peers that use sign language. Users can record their voice or type to input text that they want to translate.
We've added a few commonly used phrases which a full version of Peace should expand on, such as "I Love You" and "Local hack day" which have shorter sign sequences to express than signing letter-by-letter.
_____
#### Challenges
Coming up with an idea and setting up the project uniformly was more than half the battle. There were several existing sign language classes and applications available, so we needed to think of a way to put a new spin on it.
______
#### What's next for Peace
* Peace is easily extendable as long as we add more words to the dictionary.
* We can also add context meaning, since not all words are used in the same context all the time.
* A side menu containing a history of sentences/translations that can be reused for quick reference.
